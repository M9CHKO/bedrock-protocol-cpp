# Relay API

The C++ relay API follows the packet event model from:

- `serverbound`: downstream client to upstream server.
- `clientbound`: upstream server to downstream client.
- `event.cancel()`: drop this packet.
- `event.replace(packet)`: forward a changed packet instead.
- `event.replace({packet1, packet2})`: forward several packets.

This is currently a packet-level relay core plus `createRelayServer`, an early live relay runtime built from `createServer` and upstream `BedrockNetworkClient`. The server runtime can listen for RakNet clients, answer ping/open-connection, handle connected RakNet request flow, emit MCPE packet events, answer `request_network_settings`, complete the login encryption handshake, and emit `join`. The `relay-test-server` example exposes this runtime so a Bedrock client can join it for live testing.

## Basic Example

```cpp
#include <bedrock/bedrock.hpp>

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    bedrock::BedrockRelayOptions options;
    options.clientOptions.minecraftVersion = "1.20.40";
    options.clientOptions.outgoingCompression = bedrock::VersionedMcpeCompression::Uncompressed;
    options.enableChunkCaching = false;

    auto relay = bedrock::createRelay(options);
    relay.markDownstreamJoined();
    relay.markUpstreamJoined();

    relay.on("serverbound", [](bedrock::BedrockRelayPacketEvent& event) {
        std::cout << "serverbound " << event.packet.name << "\n";
    });

    relay.on("clientbound", [](bedrock::BedrockRelayPacketEvent& event) {
        std::cout << "clientbound " << event.packet.name << "\n";

        if (event.packet.name == "play_status") {
            event.cancel();
        }
    });
}
```

## Live Relay Server

Use `createRelayServer` when you want a Bedrock client to join the C++ listener and have the C++ library connect to an upstream server.

```cpp
bedrock::BedrockLiveRelayOptions options;
options.server.host = "0.0.0.0";
options.server.port = 19132;
options.server.version = "1.20.40";
options.server.motd = "Bedrock Protocol C++ Relay";

options.upstream.host = "localhost";
options.upstream.port = 19132;
options.upstream.username = "Notch";
options.upstream.version = "1.20.40";
options.upstream.offline = false;
options.upstream.interactiveAuth = true;

auto relay = bedrock::createRelayServer(options);

relay.on("serverbound", [](bedrock::BedrockRelayPacketEvent& event) {
    std::cout << "client -> upstream " << event.packet.name << "\n";
});

relay.on("clientbound", [](bedrock::BedrockRelayPacketEvent& event) {
    std::cout << "upstream -> client " << event.packet.name << "\n";
});

relay.listen();
```

`createRelayServer` currently requires the downstream listener version and upstream client version to match. This keeps packet ids, compression shape, encryption, and schema encoding consistent while the full JS relay runtime is being ported.

## Packet Directions

Use the same direction names as JavaScript relay:

```cpp
relay.on("serverbound", [](bedrock::BedrockRelayPacketEvent& event) {
    // client -> proxy -> server
});

relay.on("clientbound", [](bedrock::BedrockRelayPacketEvent& event) {
    // server -> proxy -> client
});
```

For old local code, these aliases are still available:

```cpp
relay.onClientPacket([](const bedrock::VersionedGamePacket& packet) {});
relay.onServerPacket([](const bedrock::VersionedGamePacket& packet) {});
```

## Relay Lifecycle

JavaScript relay does not start forwarding backend packets until the downstream client has joined the proxy. The C++ packet core exposes that state explicitly:

```cpp
auto frame = relay.handleClientboundMcpe(mcpeFromBackend);
// frame.queued == true; packet is in downQ

auto flushedToClient = relay.markDownstreamJoined();
```

After downstream join, packets from the downstream client are queued until the upstream client has joined the destination server:

```cpp
relay.markDownstreamJoined();

auto frame = relay.handleServerboundMcpe(mcpeFromClient);
// frame.queued == true; packet is in upQ

auto flushedToServer = relay.markUpstreamJoined();
```

Queue sizes are available for diagnostics:

```cpp
std::cout << relay.downQueueSize() << "\n";
std::cout << relay.upQueueSize() << "\n";
```

## Cancel A Packet

```cpp
relay.on("clientbound", [](bedrock::BedrockRelayPacketEvent& event) {
    if (event.packet.name == "play_status") {
        event.cancel();
    }
});
```

## Replace A Packet

Use the versioned packet codec to build the replacement packet. This keeps packet id and version shape correct.

```cpp
auto codec = bedrock::VersionedMcpeCodec::forVersion("1.20.40");

relay.on("serverbound", [&](bedrock::BedrockRelayPacketEvent& event) {
    if (event.packet.name == "client_cache_status") {
        event.replace(codec.packetCodec().makePacketByName(
            "client_cache_status",
            {0x00}
        ));
    }
});
```

## Handle MCPE Payloads

The relay accepts already-framed MCPE payloads. If packets are unchanged, it can forward the original payload. If a handler cancels or replaces a packet, the relay repacks a new MCPE payload.

```cpp
auto frame = relay.handleServerboundMcpe(mcpeFromClient);

for (const auto& packet : frame.forwardedPackets) {
    std::cout << packet.name << "\n";
}

auto bytesToServer = frame.forwardedMcpe;
```

Clientbound is the reverse direction:

```cpp
auto frame = relay.handleClientboundMcpe(mcpeFromServer);
auto bytesToClient = frame.forwardedMcpe;
```

## Built-In JS Relay Behaviors

The C++ relay core includes these behaviors from the JavaScript relay:

| Behavior | C++ option |
|---|---|
| Force `client_cache_status` | `forceClientCacheStatus = true` |
| Choose chunk cache value | `enableChunkCaching = false` |
| Queue `level_chunk` before `start_game` | `queueClientboundLevelChunksUntilStartGame = true` |
| Skip duplicate `play_status login_success` | `skipClientboundLoginSuccess = true` |
| Skip upstream resource-pack handshake packets in live relay | `skipClientboundResourcePacks = true` |
| Queue backend packets before downstream join | `markDownstreamJoined()` / `flushDownQueue()` |
| Queue downstream packets before upstream join | `markUpstreamJoined()` / `flushUpQueue()` |
| Disable serverbound forwarding | `forwardServerbound = false` |
| Disable clientbound forwarding | `forwardClientbound = false` |

## Run The Relay Example

Build:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh --no-install
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1 -NoInstall
```

Run the packet-core example:

```bash
./build/relay-packet-bot
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\build\relay-packet-bot.exe
```

Expected output includes:

```text
serverbound client_cache_status
forwarded serverbound packets=1 client_cache_status=0
clientbound play_status
forwarded clientbound packets=0
```

Run the live relay listener:

```bash
./build/relay-test-server
```

Windows:

```powershell
.\build\relay-test-server.exe
```

Edit `examples/relay_test_server.cpp` before building to change:

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `version` | Bedrock version used by the downstream listener and upstream client. |
| `listenHost` / `listenPort` | Address Minecraft connects to. |
| `upstreamHost` / `upstreamPort` | Real server the C++ upstream client joins. |
| `upstreamUsername` / `upstreamProfile` | Bot display/profile name. |
| `upstreamOffline` | Use offline auth for local offline upstream servers. |
| `interactiveAuth` | Show device-code login when the Xbox cache is missing. |

Start `relay-test-server`, add the listener address in Minecraft, and join it. The terminal prints `[client -> upstream]` and `[upstream -> client]` packet names while forwarding supported traffic through `createRelayServer`.

## Version Safety

Relay tests run through every bundled protocol version in `protocol-roundtrip`. The tests skip packets that do not exist in a version and verify the behavior on versions where those packets are present.

```bash
./build/protocol-roundtrip
```

Expected summary:

```text
[ROUNDTRIP] checkedVersions=50 failures=0
```

## What Is Not Done Yet

To become a full JavaScript-style network relay, the library still needs:

- Complete Player session state after `join`, including close/disconnect behavior, batching, compression transitions, and encrypted packet queues.
- More complete `createRelayServer` bridge behavior for all login/resource-pack/start-game edge cases.
- Login/resource-pack/session state mapping between downstream and upstream.
- Live regression tests where a real Bedrock client joins the C++ proxy and the proxy joins an upstream server.

The packet rewrite core is now in place, so the next work should build the server listener around this API instead of inventing a separate relay model.
